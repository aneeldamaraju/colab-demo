    "At the minimum, a well-structured python project consists of directories containing python (``.py``) files and jupyter notebook (``.ipynb``) files. The major computational code is in the python files, and the front-facing visualizations is written in the jupyter notebooks for easier reproduciabiliy of code. \n",

    "At its simplest, the version control cycle consists of two stages: *pulling* files from Github onto the your computer or google colab, and *pushing* your modified files back to the online Github repository. The official Github tutorial for pulling existing files can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world). Pushing files can be done through the terminal as shown in the setup tutorial, but can also be done in the web UI on the Github page for your repository. \n"

    "Google colab includes an interface to easily load notebooks from Github, [https://colab.research.google.com/github/](https://colab.research.google.com/github/). This requires the url of the file that you wish to download, which can be copied from the online Github repository. For example, this notebook file is hosted at [https://github.com/aneeldamaraju/colab-demo/blob/main/main.ipynb](https://github.com/aneeldamaraju/colab-demo/blob/main/main.ipynb). Once this notebook is loaded into your Colab, it is unaffected by other changes to the Github repository, and you can modify it without affecting others versions of this file."

    "One option to get existing files is through using `!wget` to download a file from the web. We can point to files in our github repository to download them to our temporary runtime. If you start a new runtime they will need to be redownloaded, so be cautious when working with larger files. **Important**: you cannot just copy and paste the url of the file for `wget`, you must use the following url structure: ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[username]/[repository name]/[branch name]/[directory]/[file]``.
