The major computational code is in the python files, and the front-facing visualizations is written in the jupyter notebooks for easier reproduciabiliy of code. \n",

    "Google colab includes an interface to easily load notebooks from Github, [https://colab.research.google.com/github/](https://colab.research.google.com/github/). This requires the url of the file that you wish to download, which can be copied from the online Github repository. For example, this notebook file is hosted at [https://github.com/aneeldamaraju/colab-demo/blob/main/main.ipynb](https://github.com/aneeldamaraju/colab-demo/blob/main/main.ipynb). Once this notebook is loaded into your Colab, it is unaffected by other changes to the Github repository, and you can modify it without affecting others versions of this file."
